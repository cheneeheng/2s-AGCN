aagcn:
  - original model.
  - 94.7%
  - overfit, train acc ~1

aagcn_v2:
  - A does not depend on predefined A matrix. > no noticable difference.
  - Using 1 subset
    - no noticable difference. 94.3%
    - overfit, train acc ~1
  - Using 3 subset
    - no noticable difference. 94.1%
    - overfit, train acc ~1
  - Using 5 subset
    - no noticable difference. 94.3%
    - overfit, train acc ~1

aagcn_v3:
  - Added additional projection in the GCN.
  - no noticable changes. 94.6%
  - overfit, train acc ~1

aagcn_v4:
  - Merged TCN into GCN.
  - Create different sets of subsets.
  - Each set will have different kernel size in temporal dim. (1,3,6,9)
  - did not converge

aagcn_v5:
  - added se block after TCN, sct attention is removed.
    - slightly worse 93.72%
    - overfit, train acc ~1
  - without the tse block, sct attention is removed.

aagcn_v6:
  - removed TCN. Added tcn conv in AdaptiveGCN (conv_d)
  - slightly worst 93%
  - overfit, train acc ~1

aagcn_v7:
  - removed TCN, added TSE in the AdaptiveGCN.
  - worst, 92.1%

aagcn_v8:
  - creates multiple attentions instead of one in AdaptiveGCN
  - using 5 splits
    - no noticable difference. 94.5%
    - overfit, train acc ~1
  - using 3 splits
    - no noticable difference. 94.5%
    - overfit, train acc ~1

aagcn_v9:
  - uses lstm before classification.

aagcn_v10:
  - uses MHA before classification.
